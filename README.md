## Code Structure
The code is written in MQL5 language and consists of several functions and global variables. Here is a brief description of each component:

### Libraries
The code includes necessary libraries such as `stdlib.mqh`, `stdio.mqh`, `string.mqh`, and `trade.mqh`. These libraries provide essential functionalities for the software.

### Constants
Several constants are defined to control the behavior of the software. These constants include `AI_ALGORITHM_ENABLED`, `MARKET_ENTRY_LOGIC_ENABLED`, `BALANCE_MANAGEMENT_ENABLED`, and `MARKET_TYPE_OPTIMIZATION_ENABLED`.

### Global Variables
The code defines global variables such as `marketOpen` and `accountBalance`. These variables store information about the market status and account balance, respectively.

### Initialization
The `OnInit()` function is the entry point of the program. It checks the enabled features and calls corresponding functions.

### AI Algorithm Integration
The `IntegrateAIAlgorithm()` function is responsible for integrating the AI algorithm. This function is a placeholder, and the actual implementation needs to be added.

### Market Entry Logic
The `ControlMarketEntry()` function controls the market entry logic. This function is a placeholder, and the actual implementation needs to be added. The current code simulates market entry by setting `marketOpen` to true.

### Balance Management
The `ManageAccountBalance()` function manages the account balance. This function is a placeholder, and the actual implementation needs to be added. The current code simulates balance management by adding 500.0 to the `accountBalance` variable.

### Market Type Optimization
The `OptimizeMarketType()` function optimizes the AI strategy for different market types. This function is a placeholder, and the actual implementation needs to be added.

### Closing Trades and Exiting
The `CloseTradesAndExit()` function closes all open trades and exits the program. It also prints the final account balance.

### Trading Logic
The `OnTick()` function is the entry point for trading. It checks if the market is open, implements the trading logic, and simulates trading by adding 100.0 to the `accountBalance` variable. If the logical conclusion is reached (account balance >= 15000.0), the `CloseTradesAndExit()` function is called.
